# Gan_Model
This will demonstrates use of a TF Hub module based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). The module maps from N-dimensional vectors, called latent space, to RGB images.

Two examples are provided:

Mapping from latent space to images, and
Given a target image, using gradient descent to find a latent vector that generates an image similar to the target image.
